# Plane Surfaces
Planar surfaces, as landmarks in 3D:
* 4D plane landmark. Overparametrized representation of a plane = [normal,d]
* Eigen-factors Fgraph


There are also some routines dedicated to generate sinthetic planes or estimate_plane.hpp

## Dependencies
C++'14, Eigen

## Current implementations
* Eigen-Factor
* Eigen-Factor-Centered (to be deprecated)
* Eigen-Factor-Raw (to be deprecated)
* pi-factor
* BAREG

## To be deprecated (now solved by the FGraph):
plane_registration.cpp
plane.hpp
