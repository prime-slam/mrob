/**
 * This is a copy of EF Plane for comparison
 * Eigen factor Plane is a vertex that complies with the Fgraph standards
 * and inherits from base EigenFactor.hpp
 *
 * The Plane factor connects different poses that have observed the same geometric entity.
 * It is not required an explicit parametrization of the plane, so the resultant topology
 * is N nodes connecting to the plane factor.
 *
 * NOTE: due to its nature, multiple observation can be added to the same EF,
 * meaning we need to create a constructor PLUS an additional method
 *  - add_point()
 *
 * In order to build the problem we would follow the interface specifications by FGraph
 * but we need extra methods and variables to keep track of the neighbours
 *
 * This class assumes that matrices S = sum p*p' are calculated before since they are directly inputs
 * XXX should we store all points?
